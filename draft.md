node backend communicates with the supabase database to then send correct information to the frontend

ðŸ”„ Bringing It All Together

Hereâ€™s how a request flow works:

    Visitor lands on davinleong.dev (hosted on Netlify/Vercel).

    They fill out a contact form â†’ frontend makes a fetch request to your Fastify backend on Render/Railway.

    Fastify wakes up (if needed), processes request.

    Backend optionally stores/retrieves info via Supabase.

    Sends response â†’ frontend shows success message.



Fastify is the API layer.

next.js frontend fetches from fastify, fastify talks to supabase using the supabase node client
